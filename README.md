# website
This is my website project for Code Louisville.

It contains a small portfolio of recent written works, and will, I hope, contain other projects,
including any web development, or other programming.

I kept it fairly simple, because it contains written work. I wanted it to look as close to a book
page as possible. In the future, I will build out further pages, as I develop more categories of 
project to add, but I think I'll keep the same basic styling. At this point, I'll add nav links.

There is a JS script that allows for a switch to a dark theme.
There is a media query to change the size of the toggle button.
There is an nth-child CSS selector.
This website utilizes flex-box.

That's pretty much it.
