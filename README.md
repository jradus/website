# website
This is my website project for Code Louisville.

It contains a small portfolio of recent written works, and will, I hope, contain other projects,
including any web development, or other programming.

There is a JS script that allows for a switch to a dark theme.
There is an nth-child CSS selector.
This website utilizes flex-box.

That's pretty much it.
