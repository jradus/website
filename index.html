                        <p>I wrote this backward.<br>
                        At least, wrote the last two lines first,<br>
                        and worked from there.<br>
                        This is not a joke,<br>
                        but it is written like one.<br><br>
                        
                        I think the snakes in the post office<br>
                        are a metaphor.<br>
                        And I think the metaphor<br>
                        is as subtle as dozens of snakes in a post office.<br><br>
                        
                        If I opened the door to a post office,<br>
                        and was met with snakes,<br>
                        I would simply close the door and never return.<br>
                        I would probably tell somebody<br>
                        “The post office is full of snakes.”<br>
                        But there’s no guarantee they’re going to believe you,<br>
                        even less guarantee they’ll do anything.<br><br>
                        
                        The post office was full of snakes,<br>
                        but, really, what makes me think I’m so special.<br></p>
